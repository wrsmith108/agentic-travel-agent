# üéØ Current State Summary
## Agentic Travel Agent MVP - Day 1 Complete

**Last Updated**: June 23, 2025 (Day 2)  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Architecture Fixed, Ready for Feature Development

---

## ‚úÖ Day 2 Progress Update

### 1. **Security Status: VERIFIED SECURE**
```bash
# Investigation showed keys were NOT exposed!
# - .env files properly gitignored
# - No keys in git history
# - .env.example files have placeholders only
# - Good security practices in place
```

### 2. **Architecture Issues: RESOLVED**
- [‚úì] Removed Twilio, kept SendGrid only
- [‚úì] Removed Prometheus metrics completely
- [‚úì] Fixed TypeScript configuration properly
- [‚úì] Updated architecture decisions (ADR-007, ADR-009, ADR-011)

### 3. **Ready for Feature Development**
- [ ] Implement user data layer (next task)
- [ ] Build authentication system
- [ ] Create AI conversation interface
- [ ] Integrate flight search

---

## üìä What's Actually Built

### ‚úÖ Working Foundation
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind (http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend**: Express + TypeScript + Winston (http://localhost:3001)
- **Demo Mode**: Toggle switch with persistence
- **Logging**: File and console output working
- **Health Checks**: `/health` and `/api/v1` endpoints

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues (Day 2)
- **Notifications**: SendGrid only (Twilio removed)
- **Monitoring**: Simple logging only (Prometheus removed)
- **TypeScript**: Proper configuration (no workarounds)

### ‚ùå Not Yet Built
- **Data Layer**: Schemas designed, not implemented
- **Authentication**: No user management yet
- **AI Integration**: No Claude connection yet
- **Flight Search**: No Amadeus integration yet
- **Dashboard**: UI shell only, no functionality

## üîß Technical Decisions Made

### Confirmed Decisions
- ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode (despite complexity)
- ‚úÖ Session-based auth for MVP
- ‚úÖ File-based storage with atomic writes
- ‚úÖ Direct Anthropic API (not Requesty)
- ‚úÖ Demo mode for development

### Decisions Needing Revision
- ‚ùì Notification service (SendGrid vs Twilio)
- ‚ùì Testing coverage (100% ‚Üí 80% for MVP)
- ‚ùì Monitoring scope (remove Prometheus)
- ‚ùì Node-cron (keep or switch to Bull?)

## üí∞ Technical Debt Accumulated

| Issue | Impact | Fix Time |
|-------|--------|----------|
| API keys in git | HIGH | 2 hours |
| Dual notification services | MEDIUM | 2 hours |
| TypeScript config hacks | LOW | 1 hour |
| No file locking | MEDIUM | 2 hours |
| Over-engineered monitoring | LOW | 1 hour |
| **Total** | **8-10 hours** | **~1.5 days** |

## üöÄ How to Run Current Code

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm run install:all

# 2. Start development
npm run dev

# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:3001

# 3. Check health
curl http://localhost:3001/health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1

# 4. Test APIs (in demo mode)
cd backend && npx tsx src/utils/testApiConnectivity.ts
```

## üìÖ Revised Timeline

### Week 1 (Adjusted)
- **Day 1**: ‚úÖ Foundation (with issues)
- **Day 2**: Fix security + Start data layer
- **Day 3**: Complete data layer + Auth
- **Day 4-5**: Catch up + Testing

### Week 2-3
- AI conversation interface
- Flight search integration
- Dashboard functionality
- Notification system

### Week 4
- Testing and polish
- UAT preparation
- Production readiness

**Impact**: 1-2 day delay expected

## üõ°Ô∏è Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. TypeScript caught real bugs early
2. Project structure is clean and scalable
3. Demo mode implementation is elegant
4. Documentation is comprehensive

### What Went Wrong
1. **Scope creep**: Added features not required
2. **Security lapse**: Committed API keys
3. **Over-engineering**: Too much infrastructure
4. **Decision making**: Changed requirements without documentation

### Process Improvements
1. **ADR First**: Document before implementing
2. **Security Review**: Before every commit
3. **MVP Focus**: Minimum means minimum
4. **Daily Standup**: Prevent scope creep

## üìû Key Contacts & Resources

### External Services
- **Anthropic**: Direct API for Claude Opus 4
- **Amadeus**: Test environment for flights
- **SendGrid**: Email notifications (keep this)
- **Twilio**: SMS/WhatsApp (consider removing)

### Documentation
- **Architecture**: `/memory-bank/architecture-decisions.md`
- **API Specs**: `/memory-bank/api-contracts.md`
- **Data Models**: `/memory-bank/data-schemas.md`
- **SPARC Guide**: `/SPARC-GUIDE.md`

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

### Immediate (Before coding)
1. **ROTATE ALL API KEYS**
2. **Update .env files**
3. **Choose notification service**
4. **Update architecture decisions**

### Day 2 Plan
1. Morning: Fix security and architecture issues
2. Afternoon: Implement user data layer
3. Evening: Start authentication system

### Communication
- Daily standup to track progress
- Update CURRENT-STATE.md daily
- Log all decisions in decision-log.md
