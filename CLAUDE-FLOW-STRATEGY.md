## ðŸŽ¯ Claude-Flow Commands for Current Phase

### 1. Store Current Progress in Memory
```bash
# Store architecture decisions
./claude-flow memory store "architecture_status" "Day 2 complete: Twilio removed, Prometheus removed, TypeScript fixed, SendGrid-only notifications"

# Store data layer requirements
./claude-flow memory store "data_layer_specs" "Need atomic file operations, user profile JSON storage, file locking for concurrent access, Zod validation"

# Store API endpoints ready to implement
./claude-flow memory store "api_endpoints" "Auth: /register, /login, /logout, /me | Flights: /search, /monitor, /history | AI: /conversations"
```

### 2. Swarm Strategy for Data Layer Implementation
```bash
# Launch development swarm for data layer (recommended approach)
./claude-flow swarm "Implement user data layer with atomic file operations for Agentic Travel Agent" \
  --strategy development \
  --mode hierarchical \
  --max-agents 4 \
  --parallel \
  --monitor \
  --output json

# Alternative: Use specific SPARC modes
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Design file-based user data storage with atomic operations"
./claude-flow sparc run coder "Implement UserDataManager service with file locking"
./claude-flow sparc run tester "Create comprehensive tests for data layer"
```

### 3. TDD Approach for Authentication
```bash
# Use TDD mode for authentication system
./claude-flow sparc tdd "Session-based authentication with express-session for travel agent"

# Store auth decisions
./claude-flow memory store "auth_implementation" "Session-based, bcrypt for passwords, 7-day sessions, HTTPOnly cookies"
```

### 4. Parallel Agent Execution for UI Components
```bash
# Launch parallel agents for different UI components
./claude-flow agent spawn coder --name "ai-chat-ui" &
./claude-flow agent spawn coder --name "dashboard-ui" &
./claude-flow agent spawn coder --name "auth-forms" &

# Monitor all agents
./claude-flow agent list
./claude-flow monitor
```

## ðŸ“Š Recommended Implementation Sequence

### Phase 1: Data Layer Foundation (Current)
```bash
# Step 1: Research best practices
./claude-flow sparc run researcher "Node.js file locking strategies for concurrent access"

# Step 2: Architect the solution
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Design atomic file operations for user data"

# Step 3: Implement with TDD
./claude-flow sparc tdd "UserDataManager with atomic writes and file locking"

# Step 4: Store implementation details
./claude-flow memory store "data_layer_implementation" "Completed UserDataManager with proper-lockfile, atomic writes using temp files"
```

### Phase 2: Authentication System
```bash
# Swarm approach for complete auth implementation
./claude-flow swarm "Build complete authentication system with session management" \
  --strategy development \
  --mode distributed \
  --parallel

# Store session configuration
./claude-flow memory store "session_config" "express-session with 7-day expiry, secure cookies in production"
```

### Phase 3: AI Integration
```bash
# Research and implement Claude integration
./claude-flow sparc run researcher "Best practices for Anthropic Claude API streaming responses"
./claude-flow sparc run coder "Implement conversation service with Claude Opus 4"

# Memory coordination
./claude-flow memory store "ai_prompts" "Travel agent persona, flight search extraction patterns"
```

### Phase 4: Flight Search Integration
```bash
# Parallel implementation of Amadeus integration
./claude-flow swarm "Integrate Amadeus flight search with price monitoring" \
  --strategy development \
  --mode mesh \
  --max-agents 5 \
  --parallel
```

---

## ðŸ§  Memory-Driven Coordination Pattern

### Store Key Information
```bash
# API keys status
./claude-flow memory store "api_keys_status" "All keys secure in .env, properly gitignored, SendGrid and Amadeus in sandbox mode"

# Technical decisions
./claude-flow memory store "tech_stack" "TypeScript strict, React 18, Express, Zod validation, Winston logging, SendGrid only"

# Testing requirements
./claude-flow memory store "testing_standards" "80% coverage for MVP, Vitest frontend, Jest backend, mock all external APIs"
```

### Retrieve for Agents
```bash
# Before starting new work
./claude-flow memory get "data_layer_specs"
./claude-flow memory get "api_endpoints"
./claude-flow memory get "testing_standards"

# Export all memory for backup
./claude-flow memory export travel-agent-memory.json
```

## ðŸ”„ Daily Workflow Commands

### Morning Startup
```bash
# 1. Check system status
./claude-flow status

# 2. Review memory
./claude-flow memory list

# 3. Start orchestration with UI
./claude-flow start --ui --port 3000

# 4. Monitor progress
./claude-flow monitor
```

### During Development
```bash
# Create specific tasks
./claude-flow task create implementation "Complete UserDataManager service"
./claude-flow task create testing "Add integration tests for auth endpoints"

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking

### Create Status Dashboard
```bash
# Initialize project tracking
./claude-flow project create "agentic-travel-agent"
./claude-flow project switch "agentic-travel-agent"

# Analytics dashboard
./claude-flow analytics dashboard

# View implementation status
./claude-flow sparc run analyzer "Current codebase completion status"
```

### Automated Documentation
```bash
# Generate updated docs
./claude-flow sparc run documenter "Generate API documentation from code"

# Update SPARC guide
./claude-flow memory store "sparc_guide_updates" "Add data layer interfaces, update task specifications"
```

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Always use memory** to coordinate between agents and sessions
2. **Parallel execution** with `--parallel` flag for independent tasks
3. **Monitor progress** with real-time dashboard
4. **Export memory** regularly for backup
5. **Use swarm** for complex multi-faceted features
6. **Use specific SPARC modes** for focused tasks

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Immediate Commands

```bash
# 1. Store current state
./claude-flow memory store "current_task" "Implement UserDataManager with atomic file operations"

# 2. Launch swarm for data layer
./claude-flow swarm "Implement complete user data management layer" \
  --strategy development \
  --mode hierarchical \
  --max-agents 4 \
  --parallel \
  --monitor

# 3. Or use TDD approach
./claude-flow sparc tdd "UserDataManager service with file locking and atomic writes"
```

This strategy ensures maximum utilization of Claude-Flow's batch processing and parallel execution capabilities!
