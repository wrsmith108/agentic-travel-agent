  --mode distributed \
  --max-agents 4

# Store prompts
./claude-flow memory store "ai_system_prompt" "You are a helpful travel agent specializing in finding the best flight deals..."

# UI implementation

# Price monitoring
./claude-flow sparc run coder "Implement price monitoring with node-cron scheduled checks"
```

### Parallel Implementation
```bash
# Launch multiple agents
./claude-flow agent spawn coder --name "flight-service"
./claude-flow agent spawn coder --name "flight-routes"  
./claude-flow agent spawn tester --name "flight-tests"

# Monitor progress

## üìä Dashboard UI Commands

### Component Development
```bash
# Swarm for complete dashboard
./claude-flow swarm "Build flight search dashboard with active searches list" \
  --strategy development \

## üìù Memory Management Best Practices

### Store Implementation Details
```bash
# After completing each component
./claude-flow memory store "user_data_complete" "UserDataManager implemented with proper-lockfile, 100% test coverage"
./claude-flow memory store "auth_complete" "Session auth working, bcrypt passwords, secure cookies"
./claude-flow memory store "ai_integration_complete" "Claude streaming responses, flight extraction working"
```

### Coordinate Between Agents
```bash
# Before starting new work
./claude-flow memory get "api_endpoints"
./claude-flow memory get "data_schemas"
./claude-flow memory get "testing_standards"

# List all memory keys
./claude-flow memory list
