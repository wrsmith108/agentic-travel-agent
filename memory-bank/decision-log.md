## Decisions Needing Revisit

### REVISIT-001: Notification Strategy
**Issue**: Using both SendGrid and Twilio unclear  
**Options**:
1. Email only (SendGrid) - matches original spec
2. SMS only (Twilio) - simpler, modern
3. Both with user preference - complex but flexible
**Recommendation**: Pick one for MVP, add other later  

### REVISIT-002: Session Storage
**Issue**: In-memory sessions lose data on restart  
**Options**:
1. Keep in-memory for MVP
2. Add Redis now
3. Use JWT tokens instead
**Recommendation**: JWT tokens for stateless auth  

### REVISIT-003: Testing Strategy  
**Issue**: 100% coverage unrealistic for MVP pace  
**Options**:
1. Keep 100% target (slow)
2. 80% coverage for MVP
3. Critical paths only (~60%)
**Recommendation**: Critical paths only for MVP  

### REVISIT-004: Monitoring Scope
**Issue**: Over-engineered monitoring for MVP  
**Options**:
1. Keep full monitoring
2. Logging only for MVP
3. Basic health check + logs
**Recommendation**: Basic health check + logs

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **TypeScript strict mode** caught real bugs
2. **Demo mode** implementation clean and useful
3. **Project structure** well-organized
4. **Error handling** properly structured

### What Went Wrong  
1. **Scope creep**: Added features not in requirements
2. **No decision documentation**: Made changes without ADRs
3. **Security oversight**: Committed API keys
4. **Over-engineering**: Too much infrastructure

### Process Improvements
1. Document decisions BEFORE implementation
2. Stick to requirements unless explicitly changed  
3. Security review before ANY commit
4. MVP means MINIMUM - resist adding "nice to haves"

---

## Future Decision Framework

### Before Making Architectural Decisions:
1. **Document the context** - Why is this decision needed?
2. **List all options** - What are the alternatives?
3. **Analyze trade-offs** - What do we gain/lose?
4. **Consider MVP scope** - Is this essential now?
5. **Get approval** - For significant changes
6. **Update ADRs** - Keep architecture docs current

### Red Flags to Avoid:
- ‚ùå "While we're at it" additions
- ‚ùå "It's a best practice" without context
- ‚ùå "We'll need it later" features
- ‚ùå Undocumented pivots
- ‚ùå Security as afterthought

---

## Immediate Decisions Needed

### DEC-007: API Key Security [URGENT]
**Context**: Keys exposed in repository  
**Options**:
1. Rotate keys and use env.example only
2. Implement secret management now
3. Use GitHub secrets for CI/CD
**Recommendation**: Rotate immediately, env.example only  

### DEC-008: Continue with Current Stack?
**Context**: CTO review identified issues  
**Options**:
1. Continue as-is and fix incrementally
2. Pause and address critical issues
3. Simplify stack for true MVP
**Recommendation**: Pause and fix critical issues  

### DEC-009: Notification Service Final Decision
**Context**: Have both SendGrid and Twilio  
**Options**:
1. SendGrid only (email)
2. Twilio only (SMS)
3. User choice of either
**Recommendation**: Email only for MVP simplicity

**Next Steps**:
1. Get stakeholder approval on decisions
2. Update ADRs with decisions made
3. Create implementation plan for fixes

## June 28, 2025 - TypeScript Error Resolution Planning

### DEC-012: Memory Bank Structure Standardization
**Context**: Existing memory-bank directory had project-specific files but lacked standard Memory Bank structure  
**Decision**: Create standard Memory Bank files (productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, progress.md) alongside existing project files  
**Rationale**: Maintain project context during systematic TypeScript error resolution work  
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ Complete project context preservation
- ‚úÖ Systematic approach documentation
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking and decision history
- ‚ùå Additional documentation overhead
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented - Standard Memory Bank structure created  

### DEC-013: TypeScript Error Resolution Strategy
**Context**: 140 TypeScript errors blocking production deployment, need systematic approach  
**Decision**: Three-phase category-based error resolution approach  
**Rationale**: Previous success with systematic error reduction (363 ‚Üí 196 ‚Üí 140)  
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ Systematic progress with clear milestones
- ‚úÖ Risk mitigation through phased approach
- ‚úÖ Quality maintenance through batch processing
- ‚ùå Longer timeline than ad-hoc fixing
**Status**: ‚úÖ Planned - Ready for implementation approval  

### DEC-014: Result Pattern Standardization Priority
**Context**: ~40 errors related to Result pattern misuse across codebase  
**Decision**: Prioritize Result pattern standardization as Phase 2 focus  
**Rationale**: Result pattern is core to functional programming architecture  
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ Consistent error handling across all services
- ‚úÖ Improved type safety and reliability
- ‚úÖ Foundation for remaining error fixes
- ‚ùå Requires careful refactoring to avoid breaking changes
**Status**: üîÑ Planned for Phase 2 implementation  

### DEC-015: Import Conflict Resolution Strategy
**Context**: Duplicate Result/ok/err imports causing 8+ TypeScript errors  
**Decision**: Standardize on single source of truth: `@/utils/result`  
**Rationale**: Eliminate conflicting type definitions and import confusion  
**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ Clean import organization
- ‚úÖ Consistent Result type definitions
- ‚úÖ Quick wins for error reduction
- ‚ùå Requires updating multiple files
**Status**: üîÑ Planned for Phase 1 quick wins

## Decisions Requiring Implementation

### IMPLEMENT-001: Phase-Based Error Resolution Execution
**Issue**: 140 TypeScript errors need systematic resolution  
**Approach**: Execute three-phase plan with validation checkpoints  
**Timeline**: Estimated 10-16 hours total implementation time  
**Validation**: `npm run typecheck` after each phase  

### IMPLEMENT-002: Result Pattern Guard Enforcement
**Issue**: Missing `isOk()/isErr()` guards causing ~25 errors  
**Approach**: Add proper guards before all `.value/.error` access  
**Pattern**: Consistent with established functional programming standards  
**Quality**: Maintain test coverage throughout implementation  

### IMPLEMENT-003: Date/String Standardization
**Issue**: Date objects assigned to string properties causing ~25 errors  
**Approach**: Convert all Date objects to ISO strings at API boundaries  
**Standard**: Use `.toISOString()` for consistent serialization  
**Impact**: Affects auth services, session management, and user data
