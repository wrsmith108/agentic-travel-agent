# MVP Travel Agent: Comprehensive Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the development plan for an MVP conversational AI travel agent that enables users to search for flights through natural language, save up to 10 recurring searches, and receive notifications when new inventory matches their criteria.

## User Journey

### Primary User Flow
1. **Initial Conversation**: User engages with friendly professional travel agent
2. **Search Refinement**: Agent guides user through flight search parameters
3. **Results Presentation**: Agent presents flight options with clear formatting
4. **Search Saving**: User can save search criteria for weekly monitoring
5. **Notifications**: User receives email/SMS when new flights match saved criteria

### Key Features
- Natural language flight search
- Multi-turn conversation refinement
- Up to 10 saved searches per user
- Weekly batch processing of saved searches
- Email/SMS notifications
- Conversation memory across sessions

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Conversation Engine
- **Purpose**: Manage multi-turn conversations and maintain context
- **Tech Stack**: 
  - Anthropic Claude API for NLU/NLG
  - Redis for session management
  - PostgreSQL for conversation history

#### 2. Flight Search Service
- **Purpose**: Interface with Amadeus API for flight data
- **Components**:
  - Search Query Builder (converts natural language to API params)
  - Results Formatter (presents data in user-friendly format)
  - Price Tracking (monitors price changes)

#### 3. Saved Search Manager
- **Purpose**: Store and execute recurring searches
- **Features**:
  - CRUD operations for saved searches
  - Batch processor (weekly cron job)
  - Diff engine (identifies new/changed inventory)

#### 4. Notification Service
- **Purpose**: Send alerts via email/SMS
- **Integrations**:
  - SendGrid for email
  - Twilio for SMS (future)
  - User preference management

### Data Models

```typescript
// User Preferences
interface UserPreferences {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  homeAirport?: string;
  preferredAirlines?: string[];
  budgetRange?: { min: number; max: number };
  communicationPreference: 'email' | 'sms' | 'both';
  email?: string;
  phone?: string;
}

// Saved Search
interface SavedSearch {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  searchCriteria: FlightSearchCriteria;
  lastRun?: Date;
  lastResultsHash?: string;
  notifications: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  expiresAt?: Date;
}

// Flight Search Criteria
interface FlightSearchCriteria {
  origin: string;
  destination: string;
  departureDate: Date;
  returnDate?: Date;
  flexibility: { days: number; type: 'plus_minus' | 'before' | 'after' };
  priceThreshold?: { max: number; currency: string };
  preferredAirlines?: string[];
  maxStops?: number;
  cabinClass?: 'economy' | 'premium_economy' | 'business' | 'first';
}

// Conversation Context
interface ConversationContext {
  sessionId: string;
  userId: string;
  currentSearch?: Partial<FlightSearchCriteria>;
  conversationHistory: Message[];
  userPreferences: UserPreferences;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```

## Agent Personality & Behavior

### Personality Traits
- **Professional**: Uses travel industry terminology appropriately
- **Friendly**: Warm greeting, uses user's name when known
- **Patient**: Guides users through complex searches step-by-step
- **Knowledgeable**: Provides context about airlines, airports, travel tips
- **Proactive**: Suggests alternatives, flexible dates, nearby airports

### Conversation Patterns
```
User: "I want to go to Paris"
Agent: "Wonderful choice! Paris is beautiful year-round. To find you the best flights, I'll need a few details:
- Which airport would you be departing from?
- Do you have specific travel dates in mind?
- Are you planning a round trip or one-way journey?"

User: "From NYC sometime in April"
Agent: "Great! New York has three major airports - JFK, Newark (EWR), and LaGuardia (LGA). Do you have a preference? 
For April travel, which dates work best for you? I can also search with flexible dates if you'd like - just let me know how many days flexibility you'd prefer."
```

## UI/UX Design Guidelines

### Visual Design
- **Clean, minimal interface** focusing on conversation
- **Split view**: Dashboard (left) and Chat (right)
- **Color palette**: Professional blues and grays with accent colors for CTAs
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts (System fonts for performance)

### Chat Interface Elements
- User messages: Right-aligned, blue background
- Agent messages: Left-aligned, white background with subtle border
- Flight results: Structured cards with:
  - Airline logo placeholder
  - Price prominently displayed
  - Duration and stops clearly visible
  - Expand/collapse for details

### Dashboard Elements
- Saved searches list with status indicators
- Quick stats (next check date, active searches count)
- One-click actions (pause, delete, edit)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Conversation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Enhance chat interface for multi-turn conversations
- [ ] Implement conversation context management
- [ ] Add flight search parameter extraction
- [ ] Create mock responses for testing

### Phase 2: Amadeus Integration (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Set up Amadeus test environment
- [ ] Implement Flight Offers Search API
- [ ] Build query parameter translator
- [ ] Create results formatter

### Phase 3: Search Persistence (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Design saved search database schema
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations
- [ ] Add search management UI
- [ ] Enforce 10-search limit

### Phase 4: Batch Processing (Week 4-5)
- [ ] Create batch processing service
- [ ] Implement diff algorithm
- [ ] Set up weekly cron job
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging

### Phase 5: Notifications (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Integrate SendGrid for email
- [ ] Design notification templates
- [ ] Implement user preference management
- [ ] Add unsubscribe functionality

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Amadeus API Rate Limits**
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, request queuing
   
2. **Natural Language Understanding**
   - Mitigation: Structured fallbacks, clarification prompts

3. **Data Consistency**
   - Mitigation: Transaction management, proper error handling

### UX Risks
1. **Conversation Dead Ends**
   - Mitigation: Always provide next steps or alternatives

2. **Information Overload**
   - Mitigation: Progressive disclosure, smart defaults

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete flight search via conversation
- [ ] Save and retrieve searches
- [ ] Execute batch processing successfully
- [ ] Send notifications for matching flights
- [ ] Maintain conversation context across sessions

### Quality Metrics
- Response time < 3 seconds
- Successful search completion rate > 80%
- Zero data loss for saved searches
- Notification delivery rate > 95%

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
All development must follow the strict guidelines outlined in [DEVELOPMENT-GUIDELINES.md](./DEVELOPMENT-GUIDELINES.md):
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory
- TypeScript strict mode with no `any` types
- Functional programming patterns
- Immutable data structures
- Behavior-driven testing

## Next Steps Post-MVP

### Parking Lot Features
1. Flight booking integration
2. Hotel and car rental search
3. Multi-city trips
4. Price prediction
5. Group travel coordination
6. Mobile app
7. Voice interface
8. Advanced filtering (aircraft type, meal options, etc.)
9. Loyalty program integration
10. Calendar integration
