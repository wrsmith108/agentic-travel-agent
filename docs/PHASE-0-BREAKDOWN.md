## Execution Strategy

### Phase 0.1: Parallel Foundation (Day 1)
- **Swarm 1** (3 agents): Authentication System core
- **Swarm 2** (2 agents): Monitoring setup
- **Total**: 5 agents working in parallel

### Phase 0.2: Security & Integration (Day 2)
- **Swarm 3** (4 agents): Security implementation
- **Swarm 4** (2 agents): Deployment pipeline
- **Total**: 6 agents with staged dependencies

### Coordination Points
1. Daily sync at component boundaries
2. Memory bank updates after each component
3. Integration testing between systems
4. Security review before deployment setup

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All authentication flows working with tests
- [ ] Monitoring capturing all critical metrics
- [ ] Security scan passing (OWASP Top 10)
- [ ] Deployment pipeline executing successfully
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage on security-critical code

## Memory Bank Updates Required
1. JWT implementation details and gotchas
2. Security decisions and rationale
3. Monitoring thresholds and alerts
4. Deployment configuration and secrets
5. Integration points between systems
